Question -

Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of size N. The task is to make pairs containing values corresponding from arr1 and arr2 i.e. (arr1[0], arr2[0]), (arr1[1],arr2[1]) and so on.

Input Format: The input line contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase contains three lines. The first line contains N size of both arrays. The second and third line contains elements of two arrays separated by space.

Output Format: For each testcase, in a new line, you have to return an array of pairs formed with given arrays.

void corres_Pair(int arr1[], int arr2[], int N, pair<int, int> res[])
{
    // your code here
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
    {
        res[i] = make_pair(arr1[i],arr2[i]);
    }
}
